        <h4>Subject Description</h4>
        <p>This course teaches students the concepts and skills for online interactive data visualization. There are three aspects of this course:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A user experience focus on visualization design.</li>
            <li>A practical industry perspective, with guest talks from practitioners on how they use visualizations in their work.</li>
            <li>A technical component of how to execute interactive visualizations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the technical component, the course uses the building blocks for the web (HTML, CSS, javascript) to create the interactive visualizations.</p>
        <p>The course keeps a focus on the entire iterative design workflow throughout the semester and culminates in a project in which a sequence of prototypes leads to a final online, interactive data visualization.</p>

        <h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand why (the task), what (the data) and how (the idiom) we design and put together visualizations.</li>
            <li>Be able to critique and validate visualizations. Is the chosen visualization appropriate for the data and use case?</li>
            <li>Get a perspective on how visualizations are used in the real world through use case examples, from data science exploratory analysis to guided interactive storytelling.</li>
            <li>Design and build an online, interactive visualization as a final showcase project, putting together everything we've learnt.</li>

        <h4>Software and technical requirements</h4>
        <p>We will be using open-source software in this course, and in teaching we will stick mainly within the HTML/CSS/JS stack.</p>
        <p>Software like Tableau and PowerBI are geared more for exploratory analysis, but the main drawback is that they are neither free nor truly customisable at a low level. For open source data science languages like R (e.g. ggplot2) and Python (e.g. matplotlib), the interactivity is never going to be as good as a one built for the web.</p>
        <p>As the course is more design-centric, I'll be teaching <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>, the defacto data visualization library for the web. We'll also touch on other web-based libraries /platforms for interactive visualizations - Google Maps, Mapbox, Leaflet, etc.</p>
        <p>Tech-stack wise, however, students are <b>free to choose</b> any tech stack / platform that they are comfortable with (Tableau, Python, R) as long as they can create and publish the required course work and final project.</p>
        <p>For that we'll be using version control software Git, and students will need a GitHub account(free) to submit and publish all their lab assignments.</p>
        <p>This course teaches a bit of web programming, and students should hopefully come equipped with some basic HTML/CSS/JS background. Students can, however, choose to create and publish their visualizations on the web using other languages.</p>
        <p>Students should also have a code editor of their choice installed on their laptops - Visual Studio Code, Notepad++, Atom, Eclipse, etc.</p>

        <h4>Textbooks</h4>
        <p>We will be using Tamara Munzner's <a href="https://www.amazon.sg/Visualization-Analysis-Design-Tamara-Munzner/dp/1466508914">Data Visualization Analysis and Design</a> as a guidebook to understand the interactive data visualization space.</p>
