            <p>Our project aims to improve accessibility and understanding of HDB resale pricing data by using interactive data visualization. Current formats provided by government sources like HDB Resale Statistics and popular property portals such as Property Guru, Edgeprop, 99.co, and Stacked, though informative, lack interactivity and visual engagement beyond basic tables and heat maps.</p>
            <p>By addressing this gap, we seek to empower users with dynamic exploration capabilities, facilitating deeper insights into market trends and enabling more informed decision-making for buyers, sellers, and relevant stakeholders in the real estate sector.</p>

            <p>Studying indoor environmental quality (IEQ) is crucial for enhancing wellbeing and productivity. However, sensing IEQ involves simultaneously examining multiple quality metrics. A space can be influenced by factors such as temperature, sound, light, carbon dioxide, and volatile substances. The Net-Zero Futures Lab (NZFL) has developed and deployed a sensor kit capable of sensing six IEQ metrics and storing the data on a Firebase server. These metrics include formaldehyde, carbon dioxide, temperature, relative humidity, volatile substances, and light levels. Additionally, NZFL analyzes the weekly performance of a space by visualizing the data on the web.</p>
            <p>For my final project in the Interactive Data Visualization course, I aim to create a code framework for analyzing the annual performance of a space using the sensor data. The framework will plot all six metrics as a forest plot and provide interactivity for selecting data points for further analysis. I also plan to delineate the boundaries of acceptable and unacceptable ranges for each metric and calculate the total number of hours the space is habitable over the year. This study will complement the current framework of the team and help them develop mitigation strategies.</p>

            <p>The Park Connector Network (PCN) was developed to create a matrix of green connectors linking Singapore's parks, gardens, and nature reserves. It aimed to increase residents' accessibility to nature and greenery while promoting environmental stewardship. The PCN has revolutionized commuting and recreation in Singapore, allowing residents to cycle or walk through green corridors.</p>
            <p>It promotes a healthier lifestyle, provides a refreshing commute to work, and contributes to Singapore's goal of becoming a car-light city (Lee, Zhan et al. 2020).</p>

            <p>Social network analysis has made significant strides in visualization techniques over the years. However, there are still some areas that could benefit from further development. This project aims to develop a dashboard to provide data visualization on social network data.</p>
            <p>The dashboard will be focusing on dynamic visualization, user interactivity and engagement and data streaming from multiple social media platform such as twitter X, reddit, facebook, instagram and etc.</p>

            <p>Singapore, a tiny island nation in Southeast Asia, has defied the odds to emerge as a global economic powerhouse. Central to its remarkable transformation is the steadfast leadership of the PAP, led by the iconic figure of Lee Kuan Yew. Since gaining independence in 1965, the PAP has maintained an unbroken grip on power, shaping policies and governance with a vision of stability, progress, and prosperity.</p>
            <p>But what lies beneath this political dominance? What factors have contributed to the PAP's enduring success at the polls? Through interactive data visualizations and insightful analysis, we delve into the complexities of Singaporean politics, questioning, and probing the reasons behind the PAP's resilience.</p>

            <p>A page navigating through the forests of Southeast Asia to understand the mechanisms of deforestation in the regions Archipelagos. Tropical forests account for over 45% of the world's carbon removal, with Southeast Asia hosting one of the world's 3 largest congregation of tropical forests, there is great responsibility for the health of the planetary ecosystem that rests between branches of these archipelagic forests.</p>

            <p>In recent times, earthquakes have been occurring frequently across various parts of Taiwan, especially in the Hualien area. Currently, there are many platforms providing earthquake disaster prevention information or earthquake-related knowledge, but a comprehensive interactive platform has not yet been integrated. This website will provide basic disaster prevention knowledge and visualize earthquake data.</p>
            <p>The visualization part will display the distribution of various faults in Taiwan as well as the frequency of earthquakes in Taiwan over the years. After providing complete information, a quiz will be designed to confirm whether the above information has been fully understood.</p>
